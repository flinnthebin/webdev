idk how to explain this but.
since i have lived at 6 malleny st, i've had a complicated relationship with my neighbours.
i often hear my neighbour at 4 complain about me over the fence, querying my lifestyle loudly to himself.
my neighbour at 8 complains by revving his bike. i can't tell if that predates me. his daughters do not appreciate the smell.
if this is my last message, my neighbour at 4 just loudly discussed a person living at an address "denny?" used to live at
they also discussed the sale of a firearm, I cannot recall the specifics but "a" 12 gauge and "some" rifles were mentioned
person was a sibling? it is hard to say, i was confused as to whether the person discussed was me or the person with weapons?
small peculiarities like "had a brother and a sister"; "his father, you know who his father is?" but i lost all context of 
who was being discussed. feels good to journal this. relieving.
